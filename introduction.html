<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 50px;"> I'm a student at the University of Richmond. I'm double majoring in computer science and cognitive science, and minoring in linguistics and math. Apart from major- and minor-specific coursework, I enjoy taking electives in music, journalism, physics, and philosophy. At the university, I work at a lab called "Beyond Categories", where I contribute to several projects in cognitive neuroscience, and lead one of them, which broadly falls under psycholinguistics.
<br />
<br />
I'm interested in math, computer science, linguistics, philosophy, the brain, music, and complex systems of all kinds (in no particular order).
<br />
I'm a free/open-source software (FOSS) enthusiast. I personally try to stick exclusively to open-source software, making exceptions only if I have to.
<br />
<br />
In my free time, I like to listen to music of many kinds and sing classical music, play football (soccer), take pictures of the surroundings, typeset documents in LaTeX, build NLP neural networks, and re-read dialogues from "G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An eternal golden braid".</p>

<!--What follows may seem like a rant of sorts, which it somewhat it. It is a rant
of sorts because the question above is so difficult to answer. It is its answer,
or the lack of it despite it seeming within reach, that drives every one of
us crazy.

What does it mean to be in a universe? What does it mean to perceive? We know
that we are by-products of order within chaos, so what is with all this elevated
sense of importance we find when immersed within our societes --- tiny realms of
make-believe roleplay? To even begin to answer anything like this, it would make
sense to wonder why it exists, leading us into the domain of "soft" and "hard" physics,
or, equivalently, theoretical and applied philosophy, respectively.
